  <p><strong>Version 3 - <a href="http://https://github.com/AngelGryph/MadeInHeaven_Tweaks/releases">Check for the most recent version</a></strong> <br/>
    <strong>Languages: </strong>English French<br/>
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and should be backwards compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal">BG2: ToB</acronym>.  The mega-mods <acronym title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> are also supported.  This mod is not compatible with older versions of the games or with Tutu.</p>
  <p>As a WeiDU mod, this mod should be compatible with all other WeiDU mods.  There are currently no known conflicts with other mods.  As for installation order, you should install encounters &amp; quests fairly early, before any 'tweak' mods.</p>
  <p>This mod was explicitly made to be compatible with Sword Coast Stratagems, I consider it to be something of a "companion" mod to SCS.  It can be installed either before or after SCS, but installing it before is generally recommended.</p>
  <p>This mod is currently untested with EET, however as far as I know there is nothing in it that requires special treatment under EET so it should work.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Before you install</strong><br/>
  If you have an older version of MiH Encounters &amp; Quests, be sure to completely remove it first before trying to unpack and install the new version!</p>
  <p><strong>Vanilla BG2 and Baldur's Gate Trilogy</strong><br/>
  Before installing this mod, you must install the latest official patch, and you must also install the Throne of Bhaal Extender (ToBEx) and the G3 Fixpack version 11 or higher.  This mod will not work correctly without those two installed!</p>
  <p>It is also highly recommended to install Infinity Animations with at least all the Icewind Dale animations.  If not, the mod will fall back to default animations, but it will make many creatures less distinct.</p>
  <p><strong>BG1EE and Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br/>
  If you obtained your version of the game through Steam or GoG, you must run modmerge or install the A7-dlcmerger mod before installing any WeiDU mods like this one.  If you obtained your game from Beamdog, this is not required.</p>
  <p><strong>BG2EE and Extended Edition Trilogy</strong><br/>
  There are no requirements at this time.  For EET, install this mod after EET has been installed but before the EET installation is finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br/>
Made in Heaven: Encounters &amp; Quests is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a zip archive.  Modern versions of Windows have support for zip files built in, just double-click the archive to open it, and extract the contents to your game file.  If you are still using an older version of Windows, you should install WinZip or a similar program to extract the archive.</p>
  <p>Your game folder should then contain a mih_eq folder and setup-mih_eq.exe. To install, double-click setup-mih_eq.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-mih_eq.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.  To uninstall the entire mod without questions, run setup-mih_eq.exe --uninstall from a command line in your game directory.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br/>
    Made in Heaven: Encounters &amp; Quests is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a mih_eq folder, setup-mih_eq, and setup-mih_eq.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-mih_eq.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br/>
    Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game installation directory.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already, download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least) the weidu executable to a $PATH directory (/usr/local/bin is commonly used).</p>
  <p>To install, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory and
 run <strong>weidu --log setup-mih_eq.debug mih_eq/setup-mih_eq.tp2</strong> from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>
  <p>Note: The readme files of some older mods recommend running tolower on Linux prior to installation.  <b>Don't do this on an Enhanced Edition game, you will break it!</b>  Modern versions of tolower will actually refuse to run in a EE game directory.  At any rate, the contents of MiH: Encounters &amp; Quests are already all lower case, there is no need for tolower.</p>
  <p><strong>New Game required!</strong><br/>
  After installing this mod you must start a new game.  This mod edits area files and stores, both of which are stored in your save game after you have visited them.  Continuing a saved game after installing this mod will have unexpected and likely undesired results.</p>
</div>
<h2>Component Descriptions</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod consists of several components, each of which can be installed or removed independently from the others.<p>
  <h3>Item Tweaks</h3>
  <p><strong>Alternative Damage on Large Creatures</strong><br/>
  An unused feature of the engine is to have weapons use an alternative damage dice roll on creatures with BIT13 set in their creature flags.  This tweak uses this feature to implement the rule that certain weapons do more (swords, most large weapons) or less (most small weapons) damage on creatures larger than a human.</p>
  <p>Warning: Items enhanced by this tweak should not be edited in DLTCEP as DLTCEP has a bug that wipes the alternative damage dice from the item upon saving.  I have not tested this in Near Infinity.</p>

  <p><strong>Cap Charges of Wands and Staves</strong><br/>
  This modification caps the maximum number of charges of wands to 6 and staves to 12.  Other items operating on charges are not affected.  The values can be tweaked in the .ini file.</p>

  <h3>Spell Tweaks</h3>
  <p><strong>Protection from Evil blocks Domination</strong><br/>
  With this modification, characters under a Protection from Evil affect can no longer be dominated by someone else's will.  This will block spells like Domination and Mental Domination, as well as a vampire's gaze.  Note that it does not block Charm-type spells as these merely twist a character's perception of friend and foe instead of crushing their will.  So Charm Person and Dire Charm will not be blocked.</p>

  <p><strong>Spell Level affects Saving Throws</strong><br/>
  Under second edition rules, a first level spell has the same saving throw as a ninth level one.  In third edition rules, the spell's level factors in the saving throw against it.  This modification implements that rule; all arcane and divine spells that have saving throws will now have a penalty to the roll equal to the spell level.  If the spell already had a flat penalty, the two will be cumulative.  So a fifth level spell that forces its target to save vs. spell at -2 will instead force them to save at -7.  This makes high-level spells quite dangerous even to high-level characters.</p>

  <p><strong>Dismissable Spells (BETA)</strong><br/>
  This component lets magic users dismiss some of their own spells at will.</p>
  <p>Summoned monsters (but not gated ones like fiends and celestials) now have a <i>Dismiss</i> button in their special ability tab.</p>
  <p>Weapons created by spells, like <i>Flame Blade</i> and <i>Melf's Minute Meteors</i> now add a special ability that allows dismissing the created weapon.  This currently only works for <i>Flame Blade, Spiritual Hammer, Melf's Minute Meteors</i> and <i>Energy Blades</i></p>
  <p>This component is still in beta, use at your own risk.</p>

  <h3>Challenge Tweaks</h3>
  <p><strong>Give Monsters Bonus HP</strong><br/>
  This component provides a number of bonus hit points to certain monsters, making them tougher than usual.  The exact number scales with the square of their HD (level1 squared times ratio/100), making later monsters tougher to be more of a challenge to a high-level party.  The ratio for different monster types can be adjusted in the ini file.</p>

  <h3>Game Rule Tweaks</h3>
  <p><strong>Revised Strength Table</strong><br/>
  This patches the tables associated with strength to be more like 3.5e.  Bonuses start at 12 instead of 16 and the effects of exceptional strength are towned down a notch.</p>
  <table>
  <tr><th></th><th>TO_HIT</th><th>DAMAGE</th></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>

  <tr><td>23</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr>
  <tr><td>24</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr>
  <tr><td>25</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>BEND_BARS_LIFT_GATES and WEIGHT_ALLOWANCE remain as is, as do stats for strength below 12.</p>

  <p><strong>Revised Dexterity Table</strong><br/>
  This installs a revised dexterity table.  Bonus start at 12 and the effects of very high dexterity are toned down somewhat.</p>
  <table>
  <tr><th></th><th>REACTION</th><th>MISSILE</th><th>AC</th></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>17</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>-2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>19</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>20</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>21</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>22</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>23</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>24</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>-4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>25</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>-4</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>Effects of dexterity below 12 remain unchanged.  Note: REACTION is displayed on your character sheet but has no effect in-game.</p>

  <p><strong>Revised Constitution Table</strong><br/>
  This installs a revised constitution table.  Bonus start at 12 and the effects of very high constitution are toned down somewhat.</p>
  <table>
  <tr><th></th><th>OTHER</th><th>WARRIOR</th><th>MIN_ROLL</th></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>17</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>19</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>20</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>21</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>22</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>23</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>24</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>25</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>REGENERATION_RATE and FATIGUE_BONUS remain unchanged, as do the effects of constitution below 12.</p>
